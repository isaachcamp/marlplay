# Two species and two resources – with a single agent of each species

A simple environment modelling the accumulation and allocation of phosphorus and complex sugars by a generic mycorrhizal fungi and partner tree. 

- Each agent must allocate sugars toward growth, defence or reproduction.
- The two species have asymmetric access to each resource – the fungus is a capable forager of phosphorus but has no capacity to create complex sugars, whereas the tree is a poor forager of phosphorus but can generate its own sugars. 
- Trading is allowed between the species where they intersect.
